My config files for Vim and Unix shell.
=======================================

This is a collection of my configuration files under a Unix system.

Installation
------------
Coming soon...

###Plugins

You will need to complie YCM.
If you want semantic support for C-family languages run:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe
    ./install.sh --clang-completer

However, *without* semantic support for C-family languages run:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe
    ./install.sh
